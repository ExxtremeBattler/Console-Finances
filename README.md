# Console Finances

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that analyses financial records and returns useful information to the user.

Through this project, I learnt quite a bit about Javascript, interating, arrays, rounding, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

To use the program, open up Chrome DevTools (shortcuts are Control + Shift + I on Windows, or Command + Option + I on Mac) and navigate to the 'Console' tab.
Some relevant information about the financial records will be displayed there.
